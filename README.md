# Learning-About-BSTs
A small educational game to learn about Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
***************************************
**Welcome to BST!**
***************************************
The goal of this game is to help you learn about Binary Search Trees, and is a term project done for Carnegie Mellon's 15-110 class, Principles of Computing. This project was completed in collaboration with Mark Coopershlyak, a fellow Carnegie Mellon student. This is a very early coding effort and was a first attempt at a larger-scale, self-directed coding project.
***************************************
**Modules and files**
***************************************
The only file of importance is BSTMasterFile.py, which is the file for launching the game. To do this, open it in an editor and run the code. The other files are all images that are used in the game itself.
***************************************
**Necessary Dependencies**
***************************************
You will only need Tkinter and the PIL images library. Other than that, all other dependencies should already be built in
***************************************
**Playing the games**
***************************************
The games are mostly based on keyboard and mouse interaction, and the two different modes will task you with building and identifying Binary Search Trees.
